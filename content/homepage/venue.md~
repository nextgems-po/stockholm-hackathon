##### Lunch Options

As lunch will not be provided by us at the MPI, you will have to make arrangements yourself.
However, there are numerous options in close proximity to the institute. 
A list of lunch places can be found [**here**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sxq1RREWATew5Xg76).

The list provides a small assortment to aid your decision making. But especially in the nearby [**Grindel**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cREtJBE5V3DpAopM6) area you will be able to find many more cafes and restaurants
to visit during lunch breaks.
