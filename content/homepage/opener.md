**Welcome to the 6th and Final Hackathon of the nextGEMS Project**  

It is time for the final NextGEMS hackathon. The Stockholm hackathon (aka The final countdown) will offer opportunities to share and learn about highlights from the project themes thus far, to plan for and hack towards the final deliverables of the project with your theme members, to delve into renewable energy challenge problems, and to look forward into the future at collaborations and projects beyond NextGEMS. Focus is on hacking!

The challenge problem for this hackathon will center around renewable energy applications and explore how these can be enhanced using the high-resolution capabilities of nextGEMS simulations.

The final nextGEMS hackathon will take place in **Stockholm, Sweden**, from **Tuesday, March 25th to Friday, March 28th, 2025**.  

We look forward to your participation!
